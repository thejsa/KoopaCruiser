# Koopa (Web) Cruiser
A basic demo of using HTTP:C on 3DS to grab a webpage (the bare foundations for making a browser).

NOTE: This hasn't been updated in a very long time -- https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-examples is probably a far better bet if you want to see good code.

# Features
- Show the source of a preset page (char *url = "http://jsa.paperplane.io/index.html")
- Save aforementioned page to a file
- tl;dr nothing of use to you

# Credits
